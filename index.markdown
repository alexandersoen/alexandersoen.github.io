I am a PhD student at the Australian National University, under the supervision of Richard Nock, Ke Sun, and Lexing Xie. I am interested in a wide range of research topics. Previously I have worked on topics including formal methods / theorem provers, visualisation in academic influence, knowledge graphs, and universal approximation theorems. I am also interested in point process models. My primary focus is on utilising boosting algorithms, information geometric tools, and the theory of loss functions with a focus on fairness and privacy in machine
learning.
