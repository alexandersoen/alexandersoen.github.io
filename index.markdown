I am a PhD student at the Australian National University, under the supervision of Richard Nock, Ke Sun, and Lexing Xie.
I am also a student trainee in Masashi Sugiyama's Imperfect Information Learning Team at RIKEN AIP.
I was previously an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon and am currently a Student Researcher Intern at Google.

My research focus is on utilising boosting algorithms, information geometric tools, and the theory of loss functions with a focus on fairness and
privacy in machine learning.
In this research, I have co-created the [pyBregMan](https://franknielsen.github.io/pyBregMan/index.html) open-source Python package with Frank Nielsen.
Recently, I have been exploring topics involving generalization bounds and theory involving classification with rejection and importance weighting. Previously I have worked on topics including formal methods / theorem provers, visualisation in academic influence, knowledge graphs, universal approximation theorems, and point process models.
